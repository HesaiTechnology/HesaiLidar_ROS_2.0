```


### Real time playback

In the configuration file, set `source_type` to `1`, then configure the parameters under `lidar_udp_type`. Generally, you only need to configure `device_ip_address`, `udp_port`, and `ptc_port`. If the point cloud destination IP is multicast, you need to configure `device_ip_address`. It is recommended to configure `correction_file_path` to prevent point cloud parsing failures when the lidar angle calibration file acquisition fails. Then run start.launch.

### Parsing PCAP file

In the configuration file, set `source_type` to `2`, then configure the parameters under `pcap_type`. Generally, you need to configure `pcap_path`, `correction_file_path`, and `firetime_file_path`. For detailed information about `pcap_play_synchronization` and `pcap_play_in_loop` functionality, please refer to the parameter introduction section in the SDK README. Then run start.launch.

### Record and playback ROSBAG file

- Record ：

    When playing or parsing PCAP in real-time, set `send_packet_ros` to `true`, start another terminal and enter the following command to record the data packet ROSBAG.
        
        rosbag record ros_send_packet_topic

- Playback ：

    First, replay the recorded rosbag file `test.bag` using the following command.
        
        rosbag play test.bag

    Set the `source_type` in the configuration file to `3`, then configure the parameters under `rosbag_type`. Generally, you need to configure `correction_file_path` , `firetime_file_path` and `ros_recv_packet_topic`(the topic name of rosbag, under `ros`), then run start.launch.

### Parsing serial data

In the configuration file, set `source_type` to `4`, then configure the parameters under `serial_type`. Generally, you need to configure `rs485_com` and `rs232_com`. It is recommended to configure `correction_file_path` (required if `rs232_com` is not used). For other parameters, please refer to the parameter introduction section in the SDK README. Then run start.launch.

### Realize multi lidar fusion

According to the configuration of a single lidar, multiple drivers can be created in `config.yaml`, as shown in the following example

```yaml
